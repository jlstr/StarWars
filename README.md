A sample App showcasing a clean Layered Architecture for Networking using OperationQueue, and the Codable protocol to populate JSON Objects from an API. Based on William Boles' excellent article: [BUILDING A NETWORKING LAYER WITH OPERATIONS](https://williamboles.me/building-a-networking-layer-with-operations/).

The API is [The Star Wars API](http://swapi.co).
